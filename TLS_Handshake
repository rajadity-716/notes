| 1    | Client says hello (OS info, encryption methods)      | âœ… **ClientHello**: includes supported TLS versions, cipher suites, and random nonce      | Perfect understanding                   |
| 2    | Server responds with encryption method + certificate | âœ… **ServerHello + Certificate**: server picks cipher, sends cert with public key         | Right                                   |
| 3    | Client encrypts session key and sends                | ðŸ”„ **ClientKeyExchange**: Sends a *pre-master secret* encrypted with serverâ€™s public key | Close, but it's not yet the session key |
| 4    | Server decrypts key and sends success message        | âœ… Server uses private key to decrypt, computes session key, sends **Finished**           | Correct, this finalizes the negotiation |
| 5    | Client acknowledges and confirms success             | âœ… Client also sends **Finished** to confirm and activate secure session                  | Great!                                  |



âœ… Summary of Flow:

  ClientHello: "Here's what I support"

  ServerHello + Certificate: "Here's what Iâ€™ll use + my identity"

  ClientKeyExchange: "Here's a pre-master secret encrypted using your public key"

  Key Derivation on both sides

  Finished messages: Both verify the session is secure

âœ… Secure HTTPS connection established
